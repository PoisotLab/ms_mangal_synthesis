# Responses to reviewer 2

Poisot et al summarize the geographic and environmental coverage of networks
included in the `mangal.io` database. They report the interesting finding that
parasitism networks have been studied in colder and drier climates; mutualism
networks in wetter climates; and that predation networks display less of a bias.
I reviewed this manuscript previously, and have found that the authors did a
commendable job addressing most of my concerns. The manuscript now presents
much more realistic suggestions for utility of the database and future
directions.

I am still unclear about how well aligned the current database is with their
suggestion for future research versus what the database can be used for now. It
would be helpful to add a couple sentences with quantitative information about
the current database in the sections proposing future research. For example,
they state that they are confident that networks along ecological gradients can
be pursued with the data, but it is not clear how many data sets in their
database reflect consistent sampling of any given community across and
ecological gradient.

They additionally highlight the utility of the database to serve as a baseline
for re-sampling of networks in the future. However, they do not state how many
of the networks currently in their database reflect repeated sampling over time,
relative to their call for resampling.
